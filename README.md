Hello World!
I used to think that cats loved me and maybe my hidden talent was being a cat whisperer.  I now understand that I was delusional.  It's not that they loved me and wanted to be around me all the time.  It was more how they knew they could control me and act out to the extent they ultimately got their way.  It was as bad as them in collusion and hearding me the direction of what they wanted - Canned food, treats, rub down, play, open a closed door or just to get me up to steal my warm comfy seat.  I finally learned that I was just a pawn in their world.
